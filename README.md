# Sheffield_decay_ABM
Final code (upon first submission) from thesis to create agent-based models to analyse tooth decay in Sheffield.

Final code for both of the agent-based models ('Sheffield_East' and 'Sheffield_West') used to test a neighbourhood based theoretical framework
(Macintyre et al, 2002) on the effects of tooth decay in neighbourhoods in Sheffield. The agent population was created using the code for
a spatial microsimualtion model, which can be found at - https://github.com/tombro1987/SMStoothdecay.
